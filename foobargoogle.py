##LEVEL 1##
# Write a function solution(area)
# that takes as its input a single unit of measure
# representing the total area of solar panels you have
# (between 1 and 1000000 inclusive) and
# returns a list of the areas of the largest squares
# you could make out of those panels, starting
# with the largest squares first.
# So, following the example above, solution(12) would return [9, 1, 1, 1].
 #list = []
 #   while zooble != 0:
 #       largest_area = int(zooble ** 0.5) ** 2

  #      list.append(largest_area)

   #     zooble -= largest_area

 #   return list


# Example usage:
#zooble = 15324
#list = foobar(zooble)
#print(list)
